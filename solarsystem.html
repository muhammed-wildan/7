    <h1>Our Solar System</h1>  

  <h2>Why Is It Called The "Solar" System?</h2>
    <p>There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star.
     Our planetary system is <br>named the "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol,
    after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related to the <br>Sun we call "solar".
Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. 
Our solar system consists <br>of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, 
    Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, <br>Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and 
    millions of asteroids, <br >comets and meteoroids. 
    Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the <br>Milky Way.
  Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets and countless smaller<br> bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids and comets.
  Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy at about <br >515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We’re in one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms.
  It takes our solar system about <br>230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.
  There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral and <br>irregular. The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy.
  Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds—including Earth—<br >with many kinds of atmospheres.
  The planets of our solar system—and even some asteroids—<br>hold more than 150 moons in their orbits.
  The four giant planets—and at least one asteroid—have rings.<br> None are as spectacular as Saturn’s gorgeous rings.
  More than 300 robotic spacecraft have explored destinations beyond Earth orbit,<br > including 24 astronauts who orbited the moon.
  
  Our solar system is the only one known to support life. <br>So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we’re looking for more everywhere we can.
  NASA’s Voyager 1 is the only spacecraft so far <br>to leave our solar system. Four other spacecraft will eventually hit interstellar space.</p>

<h2>FAQ: What Spacecraft are Headed into<br> Interstellar Space?</h2>
<p>Five spacecraft have achieved enough velocity to eventually travel 
    beyond<br> the boundaries of our solar system. Two of them reached the unexplored space<br> between the stars after several 
    decades in space.</p>
    <li>Voyager 1 went interstellar in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. Both spacecraft are still 
        <br>in communication with Earth. Both spacecraft launched in 1977.</li>
    <li>NASA's New Horizons spacecraft—currently exploring the an 
        icy region beyond<Br> Neptune called the Kuiper Belt—eventually will leave our solar system.</li>
    <li>Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 also will ultimately travel silently among the stars. <br > The spacecraft used up their power 
        supplies decades ago.
